# plugin.video.openvpn-controller
A Kodi Add-On to manage VPN connections from your media center.

It is intended to use my [openvpn-cmd](https://github.com/jrmdev/openvpn-cmd) tool and will not work without it. (Linux only at this stage).

To install, simply download this repo as ZIP and select "install from ZIP file" in Kodi.
